# Carcassone Clone

## State of development
Core game mechanics are yet to be implemented.

## How to build
Building the project is available either with premake or make (through the Makefile generated by premake).
`make -D config="release"` to build the Release version. Then run it with `./bin/./bin/CarcassoneClone_Release/crclone`, note: this should be executed from the project root.
